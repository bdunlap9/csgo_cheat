# Data-Driven Resolver

The data-driven resolver is a feature in the cheat software that improves aimbot accuracy by analyzing enemy behavior and adjusting the aim accordingly. This resolver uses a custom data structure to store enemy behavior data and calculates the best yaw based on the collected data.

## How it Works

The resolver works by collecting and analyzing enemy data in real-time. Whenever an enemy is in view, the resolver collects data on their velocity, animation state, health, and yaw. The collected data is stored in a buffer, which is used to calculate the best yaw for aiming at the enemy.

The resolver calculates the best yaw by testing multiple yaw values and analyzing the hit rate for each one. The hit rate is adjusted based on various factors, such as distance, enemy velocity, and local player aim angles. The resolver also applies smoothing to the best yaw to reduce jitter and improve accuracy.

## How to Use

To use the data-driven resolver, simply enable it in the cheat software's settings. The resolver will automatically collect and analyze enemy data in real-time and adjust the aimbot accordingly. You can adjust the smoothing factor to control the level of smoothing applied to the best yaw.

## Limitations

The data-driven resolver is not foolproof and may not work in all situations. Factors such as lag, server tickrate, and enemy behavior can affect the accuracy of the resolver. Additionally, the resolver may not work well against highly skilled or experienced players who are able to intentionally manipulate their behavior to avoid detection.

## Conclusion

The data-driven resolver is a powerful feature that can significantly improve aimbot accuracy in cheat software. By analyzing enemy behavior in real-time and adjusting the aim accordingly, the resolver can help players gain a competitive advantage in online games. However, it is important to understand the limitations of the resolver and use it responsibly.
